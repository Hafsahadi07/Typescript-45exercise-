// Q23. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and
//your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
//let car = 'subaru';
//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
//console.log(car == 'subaru')
//• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
//• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
let five = 5;
let Ten = 10;
//test1
console.log("test1: five is equal to 5?");
console.log(five == 5);
//test2
console.log("\n test2: ten is equal to 10?");
console.log(Ten == 10);
//test3
console.log("\n test3:five is not equal to 10?");
console.log(five != Ten);
//test4
console.log("\n test4: Ten is greater than five");
console.log(Ten > 5);
//test5
console.log("\n test5: five is smaller than Ten");
console.log(five < 10);
//test6
console.log("\n test6: Ten is smaller than five");
console.log(Ten < 5);
//test7
console.log("\n test7: five is greater than Ten");
console.log(five > 10);
//test8
console.log("\n test8: five is equal to Ten");
console.log(five == 10);
//test9 
console.log("\n test9: ten is not equal to Ten");
console.log(Ten != 10);
//test10
console.log("\n test10: five is not equal to five");
console.log(five != 5);
