// Q20. Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains,
//rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list
//containing these items.
var languages = ["English", "Urdu", "Arabic", "French", "German", "Chinesse"];
console.log("list of languages:");
languages.forEach(function (language) { return console.log(language); });
